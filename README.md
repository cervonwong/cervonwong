![Hi!](header_image_v4.gif)

I'm Cervon Wong, a high-schooler who builds and designs _meaningful_ and _enjoyable_ products which solve real-world problems. :) [My portfolio and my blog at cervonwong.com (currently under development)](https://cervonwong.com)

Some things:
 - I only code during term breaks, which explains the patchy contribution graph.
 - I usually contribute to issues, discussions, and documentation of random open-source projects that I love to use.
 - Most of my projects on GitHub are user-facing educational or informational apps and websites.
