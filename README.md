![Hi! I build and design cool stuff.](header_image_v5.gif)

I'm Cervon Wong, currently studying my fifth year in NUS High. I build and design meaningful and enjoyable products that solve real-world problems. :) [My portfolio and my blog at cervonwong.com (currently under development)](https://cervonwong.com)

About me:
 - 1️⃣ I try to contribute to issues, discussions, and documentation of random open-source projects that I love to use.
 - 2️⃣ Most of my projects on GitHub are user-facing educational or informational apps and websites.
 - 3️⃣ When I'm not working on projects, you'll probably find me learning (spoken) languages.
 - 4️⃣ My long-term goal is to be able to use my learnt skills to advance technology for society.

Programming language preference: Dart > Kotlin > Python > Java > C++
<br>
Spoken language proficiency: English > Chinese > Japanese > Toki Pona > French

Things that I am exploring:
 - Robotics
 - Cybersecurity
 - Web analytics

My education, selected projects, awards and technical skills—summarised for you neatly in a one-page PDF. [Download my resume](https://cervonwong.com/resume).
